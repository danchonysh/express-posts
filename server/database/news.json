[{"title":"Hollywood Undead - Believe (J-Dog Verse)","article":"I broke it all and I put it to test\nPut your hand to mine and feel this emptiness\nThere's no beat in my chest 'cause there's nothing left\nNo, it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress\nWhat's another dream? You can hardly sleep\nCan you believe bad things only happen to me?\nGod knows one day you will finally see\nThat scars will heal, but were meant to bleed\nDo you realize I would lie for you?\nPlease, have my last breath, I would die for you\nI know I'm no good, but my heart beats true\nYou know I'm gonna fight, though I might be scared to lose\nYou took me in and I fucked it up again\nAn empty promise? No, I won't pretend\n'Cause in the end, we need someone to solve 'em\nNobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem","id":1612345867953}]
